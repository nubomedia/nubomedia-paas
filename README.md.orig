This project is part of the [NUBOMEDIA](http://www.nubomedia.eu/) research initiative.

The Nubomedia PaaS manager is the manager for PaaS Platform that exposes REST API to allow Nubomedia users to build and deploy applications on the Nubomedia Platform.
This is a short guide to deploy and install the Nubomedia PaaS Manager.

## Getting Started

The PaaS Manager is implemented in java using the [spring.io] framework. This manager requires that all infrastructure is running:

* [Openbaton][orchestrator] is up and running
* The [MS-VNFM][vnfm] is up, running and registered to Openbaton
* The [PaaS][openshift] is [configured][os-config] and running (this API are tested with version 1.1 of Openshift binaries)
* A keystore with the PaaS SSL certificates exists and is available on the PaaS API machine (you can use this [guide][keytool] or this [software][portecle] to do that)

## Installation

You can install the Nubomedia PaaS manager either automatically by downloading and executing the bootstrap or manually.
Both options are described below.

### Automatic installation and start

The [bootstrap] repository contains the script to install and start the Nubomedia PaaS Manager automatically.
In order to do it you can run the following command:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSkl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fhg-fokus-nubomedia/nubomedia-paas/master/bootstrap)
```

At the end of the installation process the Nubomedia PaaS Manager dashboard is reachable at localhost:8081

Afterwards the source code of the Nubomedia PaaS Manager is located in `/opt/nubomedia/nubomedia-paas`.
Check if the NFVO and/or the MS-VNFM is not installed and started, otherwise the Nubomedia PaaS Manager start will fail and you need to start it manually when the NFVO and the MS-VNFM are up and running.

In case the Nubomedia PaaS Manager are already installed you can start them manually using the provided script as described [here](#start-the-nubomedia-paas-manager-manually)

### Install the Nubomedia PaaS Manager manually

1. Download the source code from git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhg-fokus-nubomedia/nubomedia-paas.git
```

2. Change the properties file to reflect your infrastructure configuration:

```bash
vim nubomedia-paas/src/main/resources/paas.properties
```

3. Run the provided script to create the base folder for properties file (and copy the file in it)

```bash
cd nubomedia-paas/
./nubomedia-paas.sh init
```

**NOTE** if you are not root it will ask for sudo password

3. Compile the code using the provided script

```bash
cd nubomedia-paas/
./nubomedia-paas.sh compile
```

### Start the Nubomedia PaaS Manager Manually

The Nubomedia PaaS Manager can be started by executing the following command (in the directory nubomedia-paas)

```bash
./nubomedia-paas.sh start
```

Once the Nubomedia PaaS Manager is started you can access the screen session that is in another window with the ms-vnfm running:

```bash
screen -r nubomedia
```
and move to the windows named `nubomedia-paas`

## Configuration

The configuration can be fount in `/etc/nubomedia/paas.properties`.

Here you can configure:

* PaaS address
* NFVO
* PaaS API address
* MS-VNFM
* Vim (according to [ETSI][NFV MANO] Specification) properties
* NSD image
* Database
* Log Levels

After changing any configuration, you need to restart
